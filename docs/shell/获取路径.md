### 获取某个命令所在路径
```sh
which docsify

docsify_dir=$(which docsify) 
```

注：这种是无法处理软链的，如果要获取真实路径需要执行以下脚本
```sh
SOURCE="$0"
while [ -h "$SOURCE"  ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
    DIR="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SOURCE"  )" && pwd  )"
    SOURCE="$(readlink "$SOURCE")"
    [[ $SOURCE != /*  ]] && SOURCE="$DIR/$SOURCE" # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
done
DIR="$( cd -P "$( dirname "$SOURCE"  )" && pwd  )"
echo $DIR
```
